# Vibe-Roulette  
A simple roulette game built with AI assistance—my first dive into vibe coding!  

## What It Is  
This is a basic Python roulette simulator I created with help from Grok (xAI). It spins a virtual wheel, picks a number, and lets you bet (sort of). Nothing pro-level, just me experimenting with code and AI to see what I could build.  

## Why I Built It  
After 15+ years running a business, I’m hooked on using AI to solve problems and learn new skills. This started as a “can I even do this?” idea and turned into six iterations of trial and error. It’s less about the game and more about the process—perfect for a client success mindset where iteration is key.  

## How It Evolved  
- **Version 1**: A barebones number picker (see `roulette_v1.py`).  
- **Final Version**: Added betting and a spin message (see `roulette_final.py`).  
- Took about six tweaks to get here, guided by AI prompts and a lot of “let’s try that again.”  

## Tools  
- Python (super basic stuff).  
- Grok from xAI for code ideas and fixes.  

## Next Steps  
Maybe add colors or stats? For now, it’s a fun proof I can vibe code my way into tech. Excited to bring this energy to tools like Meltwater’s!
